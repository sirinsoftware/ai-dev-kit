# ai-dev-kit

One `AGENTS.md` configures **Claude Code** (Claude), **OpenAI Codex** (GPT), and the
**GitHub Copilot** cloud agent for a project — shared standards, native slash commands,
a code knowledge graph (graphify), and optional tools. The agent CLIs you use are
assumed already installed (the script verifies them; it does install graphify + Superpowers).

## Install

Run **inside the project you want to configure**:

```bash
# Core — prompts you through which agents + tools to enable
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VM-development/ai-dev-kit/main/bootstrap.sh | bash

# Core + all optional tools (Grep MCP, private-journal, Claude guardrail + process hooks)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VM-development/ai-dev-kit/main/bootstrap.sh \
  | bash -s -- --with-all-extras

# No curl? Same via wget
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VM-development/ai-dev-kit/main/bootstrap.sh | bash
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VM-development/ai-dev-kit/main/bootstrap.sh \
  | bash -s -- --with-all-extras
```

Non-interactive: append `bash -s -- --yes --agents=claude,codex,copilot`. All flags: `./setup.sh --help`.

## Edit after install

Everything you customize lives in **one file — `AGENTS.md`**. Fill in every `{{…}}` — or run
**`/fill-agents`** to have your agent infer them from the repo's code, git history, and config
(best-guess; review the `git diff` after). All three agents read it. This is where your code
standards, check tools, and PR/commit formats go:

| What you set | Section in `AGENTS.md` | Placeholder(s) |
|---|---|---|
| Project overview / tech stack          | top                         | `{{PROJECT_OVERVIEW}}`, `{{TECH_STACK}}` |
| **Code standards** + formatter         | Standards → Code            | `{{CODE_STANDARDS}}`, `{{FORMAT_COMMAND}}` |
| **Commit message format**              | Standards → Commit messages | `{{COMMIT_STANDARDS}}` |
| **PR rules + description format**       | Standards → Pull requests   | `{{PR_STANDARDS}}`, `{{PR_DESCRIPTION_FORMAT}}` |
| **Code-review rubric** (priorities, severity, merge gates) | Standards → Code review | `{{REVIEW_STANDARDS}}`, `{{REVIEW_MERGE_GATES}}` |
| **Code-check tools** (lint/type/security) | Standards → Static analysis | `{{LINT_COMMAND}}`, `{{TYPECHECK_COMMAND}}`, `{{SECURITY_SCAN_COMMAND}}` |
| **Test command** + coverage target     | Standards → Tests           | `{{TEST_COMMAND}}`, `{{COVERAGE_TARGET}}` |
| Real device / environment              | Standards → Real device     | `{{REAL_DEVICE_NOTES}}`, `{{REAL_DEVICE_TEST_SCRIPT}}`, `{{REAL_DEVICE_PREREQS}}` |
| Extra guardrails                        | Guardrails                  | `{{EXTRA_GUARDRAILS}}` |

**Only edit one other file — and only if you use the Copilot *cloud* agent:**
`.github/workflows/copilot-setup-steps.yml` — replace the TODO with your real toolchain +
the lint/test installs, then commit it to the **default branch**.

**Share vs. local — `.gitignore`.** Your agent config (`AGENTS.md`, `.claude/`, `.codex/`,
`.github/`, slash commands) is committed by default, so the whole team shares one setup. To
*also* commit something the kit ignores — e.g. the code graph, so teammates/CI/the cloud agent
get it without rebuilding — remove its line from the managed block and force-add it:
`git add -f graphify-out/`. The `-f` is what makes it stick: tracked files override `.gitignore`
and survive `setup.sh` re-runs (which regenerate the managed block). Keep `*.local.*`,
`.claude/settings.local.json`, `*.adk-bak`, `.ai-dev-kit-manifest`, `.ai-dev-kit-mcp`, and
`.private-journal/` ignored — those are personal/local.

Everything else is generated and managed for you — leave it alone:
`CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/`, `.codex/config.toml`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, and the
slash-command files.

## Then
1. **Codex:** open the project once and **trust** it (so `.codex/config.toml` loads); restart Codex to load the `/prompts:*` commands.
2. **Copilot:** pick the model in the task model-picker.
3. After code changes: `graphify update .`

## Tools & extras
**graphify** and **Superpowers** are installed by setup (you're prompted); the four `--with-*`
extras are opt-in (or all at once with `--with-all-extras`) and reversible by `uninstall.sh`.
**ponytail** and **spec-kit** install via their own plugin/CLI — see the note below the table.

| Tool | Does | Example | Enable |
|---|---|---|---|
| [graphify](https://pypi.org/project/graphifyy/) | Queryable code knowledge graph — recall, not grep | `graphify query "how does auth work"` | default |
| [Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) | Dev methodology: brainstorm → plan → TDD → review | *"Add feature X"* → it plans + writes tests first | default |
| [ponytail](https://github.com/DietrichGebert/ponytail) | Minimal-code skill (YAGNI; stdlib/native first) | *"Add a date picker"* → `<input type="date">` | plugin (all 3) |
| [spec-kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) | Spec-driven dev: spec → plan → tasks → implement | `specify init .`, then `/speckit.specify`, `/speckit.plan`, `/speckit.tasks`, `/speckit.implement` | `specify` CLI |
| [Grep MCP](https://grep.app) | Search ~1M public GitHub repos for real usage | *"find real-world usage of `<API>`"* | `--with-grep` |
| [private-journal](https://github.com/obra/private-journal-mcp) | Local cross-session memory (on-device) | *"record in your journal: chose X because Y"* | `--with-journal` |
| [Claude hooks](templates/claude/hooks/) | Deny secrets / dangerous shell (Claude only) | auto-blocks `cat .env`, `rm -rf /` | `--with-hooks` |

MCP servers (Grep, private-journal) land in each enabled agent's config; security review needs **no API key** (`/security-audit`, or Claude's built-in `/security-review`). Install the plugin/CLI tools yourself: **ponytail** — `/plugin marketplace add DietrichGebert/ponytail` then `/plugin install ponytail@ponytail` (per agent); **spec-kit** — `uv tool install specify-cli --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git`, then `specify init .` (pick your agent).

### Superpowers skills (the workflow it enforces)
In Claude Code these run as skills, roughly in order; Codex/Copilot follow the same flow via `AGENTS.md`.

| Skill | Activates | Does |
|---|---|---|
| `brainstorming` | before writing code | refines a rough idea through questions, explores alternatives, presents the design in sections for validation, saves a design doc |
| `using-git-worktrees` | after design approval | creates an isolated workspace on a new branch, runs project setup, verifies a clean test baseline |
| `writing-plans` | with an approved design | breaks work into bite-sized 2–5 min tasks — each with exact file paths, complete code, and verification steps |
| `subagent-driven-development` / `executing-plans` | with a plan | dispatches a fresh subagent per task with two-stage review (spec compliance, then code quality), or executes in batches with human checkpoints |
| `test-driven-development` | during implementation | enforces RED → GREEN → REFACTOR (failing test → watch it fail → minimal code → watch it pass → commit); deletes code written before its test |
| `requesting-code-review` | between tasks | reviews against the plan and reports issues by severity — critical issues block progress |
| `finishing-a-development-branch` | when tasks complete | verifies tests, presents options (merge / PR / keep / discard), cleans up the worktree |

### Usage examples

**[graphify](https://pypi.org/project/graphifyy/)**
- `graphify query "how does auth work"` — orient before editing
- `graphify path "LoginController" "TokenStore"` — trace a relationship · `graphify explain "rate limiter"`
- `graphify update .` — refresh the graph after changes

**[ponytail](https://github.com/DietrichGebert/ponytail)**
- `/ponytail` toggle lazy mode (`/ponytail ultra` for max) · `/ponytail-review` a diff · `/ponytail-audit` the repo
- in-mode: *"add a date picker"* → `<input type="date">`, not a library

**[spec-kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit)**
- `specify init . --integration claude` — scaffold the spec-driven structure
- `/speckit.constitution` → `/speckit.specify "reset password"` → `/speckit.plan` → `/speckit.tasks` → `/speckit.implement`

**[Grep MCP](https://grep.app)** — ask the agent
- *"use Grep to find real-world usage of `zod .refine`"*
- *"how do popular repos implement retry-with-backoff?"*

**[private-journal](https://github.com/obra/private-journal-mcp)** — ask the agent
- *"record in your journal: chose Postgres over Mongo because of relational joins"*
- *"check your journal — what did we decide about the DB?"*

**[Claude hooks](templates/claude/hooks/)** — automatic, no command
- blocks reads/edits of secrets (`.env`, `secrets.yaml`, `*.pem`)
- blocks dangerous shell (`rm -rf /`, `curl … | sh`, force-push to `main`)

## Delivery process — develop features in phases

Cross-agent slash commands for phase-separated development (planning, adversarial
critique, isolated implementation, multi-model verification). Happy path — three commands:

```text
/prepare "user can reset password by email"   research → plan → critique → defend  ⇒ Verdict: READY
/execute <slug>                               TDD implementation (worktrees for parallel slices)
/verify-feature <slug>                        format+lint+typecheck → parallel: 2 fresh reviews
                                              (different models) + codex cross-review + tests +
                                              real-device e2e + docs update ⇒ commit-message.md
                                              + pr-description.md (nothing committed/pushed)
```

Granular phases when you need them: `/research`, `/plan-feature`, `/critique` (parallel
critic subagents), `/defend` (READY/NOT READY gate), `/shard` (conflict-checked worktrees),
`/review-fresh`, `/ship-report`, `/verify-prod` (read-only). Artifacts land in
`docs/process/<slug>/`. Model routing is baked into each command's frontmatter for Claude
(opus for reasoning phases, sonnet for retrieval; Codex: start with `codex -m`); e2e lanes
run the `REAL_DEVICE_*` script from `AGENTS.md`.

Optional enforcement (Claude): `--with-process-hooks` blocks production edits until a plan
is defended and refuses to stop on a red build (`ADK_PROCESS_OFF=1` to bypass).

Guides (scaffolded into your project): `docs/delivery-process.md` ·
`docs/guides/develop-a-feature.md` · `docs/guides/test-a-feature.md`.

## Example prompt — a feature through every tool
Drive one feature through graphify, Grep MCP, the workflow, and private-journal
(full walk-through: [docs/example-prompt.md](docs/example-prompt.md)):

```text
Implement <feature> and follow our
workflow — don't jump straight to code.
1. Orient (graphify). graphify query "how do incoming HTTP requests flow and where is
   middleware registered" + graphify path "<router>" "<handler>" → integration points.
2. Prior art (Grep MCP). Search public repos for real rate-limiter middleware in our
   language (token-bucket / sliding-window); show 2-3 examples + trade-offs.
3. Decide + record (private-journal). Pick algorithm/config; record the decision AND why.
4. Plan + build (workflow). Failing test first → implement → wire in → run test/lint/
   typecheck from AGENTS.md → self-review vs Standards.
5. Wrap up. Summarize, graphify update ., report what you journaled. Don't push.
```

## Reference
- **Slash commands** (where enabled): `/pr-review`, `/deep-test`, `/security-audit` (no API key), `/progress-report`, `/repeatable-task`, `/report-html`, `/fill-agents` (fill `AGENTS.md` from the repo), `/update-tools`. Codex uses `/prompts:<name>`.
- **HTML reports/plans:** ask any report/plan command for HTML — or run `/report-html <topic|file>` — for a styled, self-contained `.html` (Catppuccin Mocha) under `docs/reports/`. The house style lives in `AGENTS.md` → Output formats.
- **Options & conflict handling:** `./setup.sh --help`. Re-running is safe (idempotent; tracked in `.ai-dev-kit-manifest`); `AGENTS.md` is never overwritten.
- **Update tools:** `~/.ai-dev-kit/update.sh .` (or `/update-tools`) — upgrades graphify + spec-kit and rebuilds the code graph; prints the `/plugin update` step for Superpowers/ponytail. Add `--dry-run` to preview.
- **Uninstall:** `~/.ai-dev-kit/uninstall.sh .` (add `--dry-run` to preview) — restores backups, removes only kit files, strips kit `.gitignore`/MCP/hook entries.
- **Docs:** [worked example — a feature through every tool](docs/example-prompt.md) · [how each agent reads its config](docs/single-source-of-truth.md) · [design](docs/DESIGN.md) · [tool catalog](docs/related-tools.md) · [QA test plan](docs/test-plan.html).
